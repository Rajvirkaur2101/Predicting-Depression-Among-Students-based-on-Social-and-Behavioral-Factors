### Predicting Depression Among Students based on Social and Behavioral Factors

#### Jan 2025 - Feb 2025
 
The project "Predicting Depression in Students Based on Social and Behavioral Factors" focuses on identifying key predictors of depression among students using social, academic, and lifestyle variables. Data preprocessing involved cleaning and stratified random sampling. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) explored correlations between factors like academic pressure, financial stress, and lifestyle habits with depression. Various machine learning models were applied, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Decision Trees, and Random Forest, with model performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores.
